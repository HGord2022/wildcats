# Model of Wildcat Evolution
### This project is a follow up to Dan Ward's & Jack Morton's wildcat inference models which are linked below. The model is expanded to include current populations of European and African Wildcats, and model demography back to the European and African MRCA. The summary stats are calculated using the highly efficient tskit package and the multi-round inference is carried out with SNPE from the SBI package be mackelab.
